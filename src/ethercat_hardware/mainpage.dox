@section usage Usage
This package exposes a single class with a simple API to initialize all EtherCAT devices found on an interface (EthercatHardware::init), and a second call to update those devices on a periodic basis (EthercatHardware::update). An application wishing to control EtherCAT devices should create a single instance of the EthercatHardware driver.
